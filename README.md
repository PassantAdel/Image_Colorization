# Image Colorization using Autoencoders

This project demonstrates image colorization using an autoencoder architecture in TensorFlow and Keras. The code takes grayscale images as input and produces corresponding colorized images. The architecture includes downsampling and upsampling layers to capture and reconstruct color information.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PassantAdel/Image_Colorization.git` 
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the script: `python your_script.py`
2. Check the output images and predictions.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 54.55% after 10 epochs. Check the sample colorized images in the script for comparison.
